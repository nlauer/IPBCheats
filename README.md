IPBCheats
=========

This project was created before I had the idea of scanning screenshots to make cheat apps. It displays all the puzzles and their corresponding answers in a grid view. The new versions of my cheat apps are smarter, and will send the users a notification when they take a screenshot that contains the answer.
